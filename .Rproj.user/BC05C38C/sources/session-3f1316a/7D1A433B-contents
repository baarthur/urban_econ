## Hi

Hey folks! I'm Arthur.

-   üáßüá∑ from Belo Horizonte
-   Economist, 24 years old
-   Yet another city/transit nerd ü§ì
-   It all started with SimCity 4 back in 2009 üèôÔ∏è...
-   ...and now I know a couple of disconnected economic theories ü•¥



## Outline

1. What is urban economics?
2. Why cities exist?
3. Some fancy theories
4. A bit of history
4. How can **we** help?


# What is urban economics?

## What is urban economics?

- Economics + geography = urban economy!
  + Econ: undestanding peoples' incentives, decisions, and their consequences
  + Geo: understanding places
  + Urban econ: understending why things are were they are
- Von Th√ºnen (mid 1850s)
- Alonso, Muth and Mills (mid 1950s)



## Where it all began

## Modern contributiuons

- Agglomeration economies 
- New Economical Geography (Paul Krugman, 2008 Nobel Winner)
- Emissions
- Transit
- Zoning
- And all of this together



# Why cities exist?

## Thinking like an economist

- City $=$ labor market
- That's what drive people *and* companies to cities!
- Strong labor market $\rightarrow$ big city



## Strong assumptions... 

- Firms concentrate on a single point (CBD)
- Families work at the CDB
- Everyone has the same income and preferences
- Consumption bundle: housing and "everything else"
- Subject to: 
  + budget constraint
  + housing costs ($\$/sq. ft.$)
  + transportation costs ($\$/mi$)
  
  

## ...but meaningful insights

- Density is higher near the CBD
- Price is higher near the CBD



## A theory is born

- Local advantages $\rightarrow$ economies of scale $\rightarrow$ **agglomeration** economies!
- Economies of scale:
  + $\uparrow q \rightarrow$ dillute sunken costs
  + Specialization $\rightarrow$ bigger production








## Thanks!
