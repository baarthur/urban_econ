## Hi

Hey folks! I'm Arthur.

- 🇧🇷 from Belo Horizonte
- Economist, 24 years old
- Yet another city/transit nerd 🤓
- It all started with SimCity 4 back in 2009 🏙️...
- ...and now I know a couple of disconnected economic theories 🥴



## Outline

1.  What is urban economics?
2.  Why do cities exist?
3.  Some fancy theories
4.  A bit of history
5.  How can **we** help?




# What is urban economics?

## What is urban economics?

- Economics + geography = urban economy!
    + Econ: undestanding peoples' incentives, decisions, and their consequences
    + Geo: understanding places
    + Urban econ: understending why things are were they are
- Von Thünen (mid 1850s)
- Alonso, Muth and Mills (mid 1950s)




## Where it all began

::: columns

#### First questions

- Locational choice
- Spatial patterns
- Role of transit costs and income

::: {.column width="40%"}
#### First answers

## Modern contributions

- Agglomeration Economies
- New Economical Geography (Paul Krugman, 2008 Nobel Winner)
- Emissions
- Transit
- Zoning
- And all of this together




# Why do cities exist?

## Thinking like an economist

![Trust me... it makes sense.](images/conspiracy.gif)

## Thinking like an economist

- City $=$ labor market
  + Labor supply ($L^s$) and demand ($L^d$)
- People migrate to cities because of **job opportunities**
- Large **labor supply** $\rightarrow$ business clustering

```{mermaid}

flowchart LR

A[Urban center] --> B(Large consumer market)
B --> C(Job opportunities \n $\uparrow L^d$)
C --> D(Migration \n $\uparrow L^s$)

A --> E(Big labor pool)
D --> E
D --> B

E --> F(Specialized jobs, \n specialized businesses)
F --> D
F --> C
```

> This feedback effect is what makes cities so attractive!



## The agglomeration economies

- Economies of scale:
  + $\uparrow q \rightarrow$ dillute sunken costs, i.e., more production $\rightarrow$ cheaper products
  + Job specialization $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow q$ per $\bar{L}$ and innovation

```{mermaid}
%%| mermaid-format: svg
%%| fig-height: 2in

flowchart LR

A[Cities] --> B(Large consumer market)
A --> C(Specialized labor pool)
A --> D(Big enough niche markets)

B --> E($\uparrow$ Demand)
E --> D

C --> F($\uparrow$ Productivity)
F --> E
F --> I(Innovation)

D --> G(Diversity!)

E --> H(Cheaper products)
H --> E

I --> J(Economic development)
J --> E
```







## Strong assumptions...

- Firms concentrate on a single point (CBD)
- Families work at the CDB
- Everyone has the same income and preferences
- Consumption bundle: housing and "everything else"
- Subject to:
  + budget constraint
  + housing costs ($\$/sq. ft.$)
  + transportation costs ($\$/mi$)



## ...but meaningful insights

- Density is higher near the CBD
- Price is higher near the CBD







## Thanks!
